== Changelog ==

= 0.6.2 =
* Testing the plugin up to WordPress 6.4.2
* Update link references from http to https.

= 0.6.1 =
* Test the plugin up to WordPress 6.2

= 0.6 =

= 0.5 =
* Remove comment_exists check for importing comments. In testing, I found no duplicated comments via this method, and it's extremely slow on large imports. If this check is needed, then define('WP_MT_IMPORT_ALLOW_DUPE_COMMENTS', false);
* Disable cache invalidation and both term and comment counting during import, for speed. Re-enable them after import.
* Disable autocommit during import, commit once every 500 posts and after complete import. Huge speed boost. To force autocommit to be left alone, define('WP_MT_IMPORT_FORCE_AUTOCOMMIT',true);

= 0.4 =
* String updates

= 0.3 =
* Use BASENAME, if present, as the slug for the post.

= 0.2 =
* Add check for WP_LOAD_IMPORTERS
